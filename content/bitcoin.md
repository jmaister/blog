What is Bitcoin?
================

Bitcoin is a new digital currency invented by "Satoshi Nakamoto", it is just a pseudonym.

It is accepted on some online services and companies, just like USD are used on USA and EUR on Europe.

What is worth?
==============

**Nothing**. Period.

They are not banknotes that are payable in gold or another type of  as the usual currencies from national banks, so the worth nothing. It was invented like that, the paper was the promise to the bearer of an amount of gold. Do not try to do it now, there is no gold waiting for you on the bank.

**The bit coins are backed on nothing.** So their value is completely speculative.

How to get a Bitcoin
====================

An algorithm keeps your computer working for hours/days/months... just to throw a bunch of numbers as result. If this numbers are "correct" you have a new Bitcoin.

As the calculations made on your computer are not used on anything else than creating a Bitcoin. Your computer power is wasted.

Watching from another point of view, it is like converting electricity into numbers.

Buy / Sell and its price
========================

Besides the hard and technical process of creating a Bitcoin with your computer, there is the possibility of buying them. Like in the stock markets. ***(Contact me to INSERT YOUR AD HERE)***

The appearing of bitcoin on these markets made its price to fluctuate as the offer and demand dictates. For this reason, the price went from $1 on October 2010 to $1000 on October 2013. Then, they went down to $650 on about 15 days. How long will it take to go down to **$0**?

Conclusion
==========

The bitcoins are created from the nothing, so they worth nothing.

There is the belief that they are used for drug traffic, weapon traffic and more crimes, so their price increased so much.

**Do not buy**, *unless you want to risk your money* and *win or loss money*.
