What is Bitcoin?
================

Bitcoin is a new digital currency invented by "Satoshi Nakamoto", it is just a pseudonym.

It is accepted on some online services and companies, just like USD are used on USA and EUR on Europe.

What is worth? (backing like gold)
==============

**Nothing**. Period.

An algorithm keeps your computer working for hours/days/months... just to throw a bunch of numbers as result. If this numbers are "correct" you have a new Bitcoin.

As the calculations made on your computer are not used on anything else than creating a Bitcoin. Your computer power is wasted.

Watching from another point of view, it is like converting electricity into numbers.

Buy / Sell
==========

Exchange...


Conclusion
==========

The bitcoins are created from the nothing. They are not backed on gold as the usual currencies from national banks, so the worth nothing.

There is a bubble on their price.
