I would like to introduce you the **Fast Discovery programming**. It is based on the discovery on errors or failures as fast as possible to keep going on the good way to achieve your goals.

**Fast Discovery**, comes from the concepts like fail-fast or fail-early, but fail is not what we want to achieve. What we want is to know what we are doing works. So that, *Discovery* is better term than *Fail*.

This concept can be applied to many fields on your life, like engineering or design, but the below examples are especially for programming.

This tips can help to become faster at programming, saving time for thinking and make things, and not waiting for things to happen like restarting a server or wait for the "Compiling..." alert to be closed.

IDE
===

First of all, learn your IDE. Learn how to use it, how it can help you on your workflow.

### Shotcuts

Learn the shortcuts for the most common actions you usually do. Some examples on Eclipse:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Alt + R | Find resource |
| Shift + Alt + F | Format code |
| Control + S | Save |
| Control + 7 | Toggle comments |
| Control + H | Find in all files |
| Control + F | Find/Replace in current file |
...

You name them. Just look for your more used actions and try to find the shortcut on the menu.

### Selection

These are the most important shotcuts! You loose important seconds by moving your hand to the mouse, and trying to select some words. Just use the keyboard.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Control + C | Copy |
| Control + V | Paste |
| Control + X | Cut |
| Shift + (up,down,left,right) | Selection |
 
If there is no more choice and you use the mouse, keep in mind the tips below. You will not try to aim your selection like a *sniper*.

* Double click: select a full word.
* Double click + move: select full words while moving.
* Triple click: select a full paragraph.
* Triple click + move: select full paragraphs while moving.


### Unwanted pop-ups

Fix common options or questions. How many times do you click on an "OK/Cancel" alert on each save or compile. Have you read it carefully? Is it a "Do not ask me again" checkbox? This can save some precious time.
