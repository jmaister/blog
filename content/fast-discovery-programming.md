I would like to introduce you the **Fast Discovery programming**. It is based on the discovery on errors or failures as fast as possible to keep going on the good way to achieve your goals.

**Fast Discovery**, comes from the concepts like fail-fast or fail-early, but fail is not what we want to achieve. What we want is to know what we are doing works.

This concept can be applied to many fields on your life, like engineering or design, but the below examples are especially for programming.

This tips can help to become faster at programming or coding, saving time for thinking and make things, and not waiting for things to happen like restarting a server or wait for the "Compiling..." alert to be closed.
