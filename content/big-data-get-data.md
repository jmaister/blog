Lastly, there is a lot of news, work offers, noise, ads, ... about **Big Data**. Because of this I decided to make my own Big Data project.

As this just would be to implement a map-reduce algorithm in any language, quite easy for any programming exercise, I wanted to give this technology an use for something real.

The data
========

Any Big Data project is nothing without the data. Otherwise, it would be called **small data** or   **medium data** (by the way, I should register this new trademarks).

The data to be processed is the files of the [BOE](http://www.boe.es). The **Bolet&iacute;n Oficial del Estado** (BOE) is a daily Spanish-government publication in which new laws, directives and executive decisions are published together with advertisements for public-sector posts and contracts. It is provided free of charge to all government agencies and state organizations including schools, embassies and public libraries. (Collins Spanish Dictionary)


Get the data
============

For scrapping the data from the website, first approach is always to use Python tools like [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) or [webscraping](http://docs.webscraping.com/index.html). I used these tools some times before and make very easy to crawl a full website looking for information. But after some research of the pages, it would be very over-engineered to use these tools.

All the files follow the same pattern:

* Format: *xml* for marked documents; *txt* for plain text.
* Code: *A* for general orders, personnel and misc; *B* for Justice administration.
* Year
* ID: from *1* to the *number of documents*.


    http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/[format].php?id=BOE-[code]-[year]-[id]

For starting, I downloaded the files for years 2012 and 2013. 182694 files with 1,67 GB (1.800.364.500 bytes).

    def save_url(link, filename):

            pass
        else:
            try:
                data = urllib2.urlopen(link).read()
                out = open(filename, 'w')
                out.write(data)
                out.close()
            except e:
                print "error", e, link, filename


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()


Conclusion
==========

After getting the data, on next articles I will set up a Hadoop environment for programming and analyse the data.
